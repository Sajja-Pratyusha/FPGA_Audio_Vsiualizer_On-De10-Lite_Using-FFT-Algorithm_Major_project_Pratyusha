ABSTRACT

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms play a crucial role in digital signal processing, facilitating the analysis and manipulation of signals across diverse application domains. With the evolution of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offering reconfigurable hardware platforms, there has been a growing interest in implementing FFT on FPGAs due to their inherent parallelism and
computational power. This paper presents an overview of FFT implementations on FPGAs, highlighting the significance, challenges, and advancements in leveraging FPGA technology for accelerating FFT computations. We discuss optimization techniques, resource utilization, integration with system architectures, and scalability aspects of FPGA-based FFT designs. Furthermore, we explore emerging trends and future directions in FFT on FPGAs, including low-power design, integration with high-level
synthesis tools, and exploration of novel architectures. Through a comprehensive examination of FFT in
FPGA implementations, this paper aims to provide insights into the potential and challenges of utilizing FPGA technology for accelerating FFT computations and advancing digital signal processing capabilities.
